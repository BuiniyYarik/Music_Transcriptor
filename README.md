# Music Transcriptor

## Introduction

This GitHub project focuses on the Music Transcription and Instrument Separation using Neural Networks. Our goal is creation of the convenient tool for musicians and composers that allows efficiently process musical compositions for future modifications and performancing.

The project mainly based on the following source: https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/76991/1/Automatic_music_transcription_using_neural_networks_MINGUEZ_CARRETERO_MANUEL.pdf


## Features

- **Music Transcription:** Our neural networks can convert raw audio recordings into musical notation, making it easier to analyze and modify the compositions, and even play music during performances.

- **Instrument Separation:** We've developed models that can separate different musical instruments from a mixed audio track, giving you the power to isolate and manipulate specific elements of a song.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with our project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can find them in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. **Explore the Notebooks:** Check out our Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. These notebooks provide examples and tutorials on how to use our models for music transcription and instrument separation.


## Usage (Not Actual Now)

Our models are designed to be versatile and adaptable. You can use them in various ways:

- **Music Transcription:** Use our pre-trained models to transcribe audio recordings into sheet music or MIDI files.

- **Instrument Separation:** Apply our models to separate and isolate specific instruments from mixed audio tracks.
